title: "Data-Driven Multiscale Modeling in Mechanics"
excerpt: "We present a Data-Driven framework for multiscale analysis of general material behavior. The proposed framework relies on the Data-Driven formulation in mechanics (KirchDoerfer et al., 2016), with the material data being directly extracted from lower-scale computations. Particular emphasis is placed on two key elements: the parametrization of material history, and the optimal sampling of the mechanical state space. We demonstrate the framework in the prediction of the mechanical behavior of sand, a prototypical history-dependent granular material. In particular, the framework is able to predict the nonmonotonic response under complex loading paths, and captures shear banding in 2D and 3D boundary value problems."
