title: "Stochastic plasticity"
excerpt: "Presented here is a finite element framework for the solution of stochastic
elastoplastic boundary value problems with non-Gaussian parametric uncer-
tainty. The framework relies upon a stochastic Galerkin formulation, where
the stiffness random field is decomposed using a multidimensional polyno-
mial chaos expansion. At the constitutive level, a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov
(FPK) plasticity framework is utilized, under the assumption of small strain
kinematics. A linearization procedure is developed that serves to update
the polynomial chaos coefficients of the expanded random stiffness in the
elastoplastic regime, leading to a nonlinear least-squares optimization prob-
lem. The proposed framework is illustrated in a static shear beam example
of elastic-perfectly plastic as well as isotropic hardening material"
