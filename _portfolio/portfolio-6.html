title: "Data-Driven Design of Disordered Materials (D4M)"
excerpt: "We develop a Data-Driven framework for multiscale mechanical analysis of materials. The proposed framework relies on the Data-Driven formulation in mechanics, with the material data being directly extracted from lower-scale computations. Particular emphasis is placed on two key elements: the parametrization of material history, and the optimal sampling of the mechanical state space. We demonstrate an application of the framework in the prediction of the behavior of sand, a prototypical complex history-dependent material. In particular, the model is able to predict the material response under complex nonmonotonic loading paths, and compares well against plane strain and triaxial compression shear banding experiments."

<p> The <span style="font-weight:bold"> Marie Skłodowska Curie Action </span> “D4M: Data-Driven Design of Disordered Materials” 
  is funded by the European Research Council’s Horizon 2020 program under the call H2020-MSCA-IF-2020.</p>

<p> With increasingly advanced manufacturing techniques, architected materials or metamaterials continue to gain
popularity. Yet, the vast majority of these materials are designed with a periodic and regular lattice structure. 
On the other hand, architected disordered materials have received little attention despite their robustness and 
 flaw tolerance compared to regular lattice-based materials. This is largely due
to their vast design space, which has been inaccessible with standard sampling techniques. The aim of the project
D4M ("Deform") is the development of a novel rational framework for data-driven, and hence experience-free,
design of materials, that systematically exploits disorder. The framework relies on four synergistic elements: i) a
unified network-theoretic representation of disordered material architectures, ii) the use of mechanics and complex
networks as tools for evaluating design objectives, iii) the development of efficient graph machine learning tech-
niques for executing the design, and iv) the practical implementation and validation of a suite of designs by additive
manufacturing and testing. By focusing on design objectives such as high energy absorption and tailored nonlinear
deformation response, the proposed research is expected to have a diverse impact in the design of cellular, granular
and fibrous materials with applications in biomechanics (prosthetics, orthotics, bioimplants) and the sports industry
  (protective equipment, clothing, shoes). </p>
