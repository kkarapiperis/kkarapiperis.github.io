title: "Data-Driven Design of Disordered Materials (D4M)"
excerpt: "We develop a Data-Driven framework for multiscale mechanical analysis of materials. The proposed framework relies on the Data-Driven formulation in mechanics, with the material data being directly extracted from lower-scale computations. Particular emphasis is placed on two key elements: the parametrization of material history, and the optimal sampling of the mechanical state space. We demonstrate an application of the framework in the prediction of the behavior of sand, a prototypical complex history-dependent material. In particular, the model is able to predict the material response under complex nonmonotonic loading paths, and compares well against plane strain and triaxial compression shear banding experiments."

<p> The <span style="font-weight:bold"> Marie Skłodowska Curie Action </span> “D4M: Data-Driven Design of Disordered Materials” is funded by the European Commission for two years and started in April 2020 at ETH Zurich. It is part of the European Research Council’s Horizon 2020 program under the call H2020-MSCA-IF-2020.</p>

<p>We develop a Data-Driven framework for multiscale mechanical analysis of materials. The proposed framework relies on the Data-Driven formulation in mechanics [1], with the material data being directly extracted from lower-scale computations. Particular emphasis is placed on two key elements: the parametrization of material history, and the optimal sampling of the mechanical state space. We demonstrate an application of the framework in the prediction of the behavior of sand, a prototypical complex history-dependent material. In particular, the model is able to predict the material response under complex nonmonotonic loading paths, and compares well against plane strain and triaxial compression shear banding experiments. </p>
