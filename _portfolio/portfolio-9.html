title: "Stress transmission in entangled granular structures"
excerpt: "We study the transmission of compressive and tensile stresses, and the development of stress - induced anisotropy in entangled granular structures composed of nonconvex S-shaped hooks and staples. Utilizing discrete element simulations, we find that these systems exhibit fundamentally different behavior compared to standard convex particle systems, including the ability to entangle which contributes to a lower jamming packing fraction and facilitates the transmission of tensile stresses. We present direct evidence of tensile stress chains, and show that these chains are generally sparser, shorter and shorter-lived than the compressive chains found in convex particle packings. We finally study the probability distribution, angular density and anisotropic spatial correlation of the minor (compressive) and major (tensile) particle stresses. The insight gained for these systems can help the design of reconfigurable and recyclable granular structures capable of bearing considerable loads, without any need for reinforcement."
