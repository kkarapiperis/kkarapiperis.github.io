title: "Data-Driven Design of Disordered Materials (D4M)" 
excerpt: "With increasingly advanced manufacturing techniques, architected materials or metamaterials continue to gain popularity. Yet, the vast majority of these materials are designed with a periodic and regular lattice structure. On the other hand, architected disordered materials have received little attention despite their robustness and flaw tolerance compared to regular lattice-based materials. The aim of the project D4M (Deform) is the development of a novel rational framework for data-driven, and hence experience-free, design of materials, that systematically exploits disorder."

<p align="justify"> With increasingly advanced manufacturing techniques, architected materials or metamaterials continue to gain
popularity. Yet, the vast majority of these materials are designed with a periodic and regular lattice structure. 
On the other hand, architected disordered materials have received little attention despite their robustness and 
 flaw tolerance compared to regular lattice-based materials. The aim of the project
D4M ("Deform") is the development of a novel rational framework for data-driven, and hence experience-free,
design of materials, that systematically exploits disorder. The framework relies on four synergistic elements: i) a
unified network-theoretic representation of disordered material architectures, ii) the use of mechanics and complex
networks as tools for evaluating design objectives, iii) the development of efficient graph machine learning techniques 
  for executing the design, and iv) the practical implementation and validation of a suite of designs by additive
manufacturing and testing. By focusing on design objectives such as high energy absorption and tailored nonlinear
deformation response, the proposed research is expected to have a diverse impact in the design of cellular and particulate materials
  with applications in biomechanics and the sports industry. </p>
