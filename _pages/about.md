I am a Marie-Curie Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Mechanics and Materials Laboratory](https://mm.ethz.ch/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research focuses on data-driven, multiscale and complex-systems modeling and design of disordered materials. I received my PhD in Applied Mechanics from Caltech at 2020. I also hold a minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Caltech and MSc's in Civil Engineering from UC Davis and the National Technical University of Athens.
