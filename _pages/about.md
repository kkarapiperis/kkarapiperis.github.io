I am a Postdoctoral Scholar and Lecturer at the [Mechanics and Materials Laboratory](https://mm.ethz.ch/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research focuses on data-driven multiscale modeling and design of materials. I received my PhD in Applied Mechanics from Caltech at 2020. I also hold a Minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Caltech and MSc's in Civil Engineering from UC Davis and the National Technical University of Athens.
