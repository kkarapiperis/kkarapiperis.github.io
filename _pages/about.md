I am an Assistant Professor and Director of the [Data-Driven Mechanics Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lmd/) at EPFL. Previously I have have been a Postdoctoral Scholar and Lecturer at the Mechanics and Materials Laboratory at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research focuses on data-driven multiscale modeling and design of materials, with special interest in granular materials, soft materials, and structural materials. I received my PhD in Applied Mechanics from Caltech at 2020. I also hold a Minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Caltech and MSc's in Civil Engineering from UC Davis and the National Technical University of Athens.
